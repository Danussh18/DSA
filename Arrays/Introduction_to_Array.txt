Introduction to Array

Advantages of using Array Data Structure is
  1. Cache Friendly
  2. Random Access
  3. Contiguous memory location
  
Types of Arrays
  1. Fixed Size
  2. Dynamic Size
  
  1. Fixed Size: Array
      a. int[] arr = new int(size);
      b. int arr[] = {10,20,30,40};
      c. int[] arr = new int[1000];
  
  2. Dynamic size: Linked List
      a. Initially it allocates to some capacity, once capacity is full. It just creates double the capacity size
         and copies the elements from old array to newly created array.
         
  In java Arrays are alocated at heap so it becomes always easy for the allocation of memory in java
  not that complicated compared to C++ or C.
